* October 2022: **Repair** crank no start by replacing entire starter motor at 284.400 km 
  * Failure reason: Aparent stock starter's **solenoid** fail (driving 12V into the solenoid trigger-pin should have only pushed the starter gears forward but it also spinned them)

    * Oil and filter change labor + Bosch Filter (P7221, F026407221) + free basic car check 59.0 EUR from Feuvert
* October 2022: **Preventive refill and bleeding cooling system** after unmounting some noses during starter replacement (which was not necessary)
  * Bleed cooling system air method:
    * Install new hardware
    * Attach no-spill coolant funnel
    * Fill to half-full
    * Make sure HVAC/Heat/Fan is OFF
    * Start car
    * Add coolant as needed
    * Watch for bubbles
    * Use a steering wheel lock, stick, 2x4, something long or heavy and use it to depress the accelerator pedal and give the engine some load other than idle (2000rpm - 3000rpm is what I go for)
    * Add coolant as needed
    * Watch for bubbles
    * Wait for fan to turn on
    * Be paranoid and watch for more bubbles
    * Done!
  * However: I didn't bleed enough air, so after a few days the coolant reservoir was at the minimum and had to refill. During those days I observed some possible coolant leaks apparently from the water pump, but after the air bleeding seemed to settledown I did not observe any more leaks. Could it also be because the weather was getting cooler?
