## Periodization context
Plans for off-season and season periods with hypertrophy, strength, power and plyometrics as well as bulking, cutting and weight maintenance periods based on (beach soccer) competition dates with peaks and deloads. This is not optimal for bodybuilding as these goals are very broad.

* Training philosophy and goals for 2024:
  * Strength and explosiveness as an expression of 'specifity training' (train "strength"/"explosiveness/plyometrics" in the closest way as possible to the actual sport). As a goalkeeper and volleyball player this includes:
    * Vertical jump
    * Lateral jump
    * Short sprints
    * Reaction time
    * Goalkeeper/Volleyball receiver stance (stability)
    * Static
    * All-direction movements
    * Wrist strength (extension)
    * Contact strength (from front and side angles)
  * Mantain plyometric capabalities all year round (at least 2 sessions per week) as well as sport specific skills
  * Ramp-up volume and intensity with a deload phase before the competitions.
  * Gain muscle during off-season, cut weight before competition and maintain weight through competition season.
  * Competition dates
    * Winter cup: December 7th-10th
    * San Juan cup: March
    * Season: May, June, July
