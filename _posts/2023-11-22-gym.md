## Periodization context
Plans for off-season and season periods with hypertrophy, strength, power and plyometrics as well as bulking, cutting and weight maintenance periods based on (beach soccer) competition dates with peaks and deloads. This is not optimal for bodybuilding as these goals are very broad.

* Training philosophy and goals for 2024:
  * Strength and explosiveness as an expression of 'specifity training' (train "strength"/"explosiveness/plyometrics" in the closest way as possible to the actual sport). As a beach soccer goalkeeper this includes:
    * Front and backwards jogging on sand cardio
    * Lateral movements
    * Lateral dives
    * Short sprints
    * Reaction time
    * Goalkeeper stance isometric
    * Wrist strength (extension)
    * Contact strength (from front and side angles)
  * Mantain plyometric capabalities all year round (at least 2 sessions per week) as well as sport specific skills
  * Ramp-up volume/intensity with a deload phase before the competitions.
  * Gain muscle during off-season, cut weight before competition and maintain weight through competition season.
  * Competition dates
    * Winter cup: December 7th-10th
    * San Juan cup: March
    * Season: May, June, July

![404]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gym/tissue.png)
* Plyometrics does not increase tendon stiffness, which heavy strength training does
  * Good to transmit energy from muscle to bone
  * So direct correlation between rate of force development and tendon stiffness
  * Good for concentrics
  * Too much muscle strength and not enough tenson extensibility can cause muscle strains as the muscle the stiff tendon yet not extensible wont allow for great tendon stretch and so the muscle is being overstretched to compensate.
* Plyometrics does increase tendon extensibility (which allows them to store elastic energy)
  * Good for stretch shortening cycle with a preload
  * Static stretching does not improve tendo extensibility

## Draft workout

### Summer beach split: Calisthenics and sand plyometrics routine

Tuesday: Practice + Lower Cali + Sand Plyometrics

Wednesday: Practice + Low level hard court plyo

Thursday: Practice + Upper Cali 2 + Sand Plyometrics

Friday: Practice + Low level hard court plyo

Saturday: Practice

Sunday: Rest

#### Upper Cali 1

### Winter gym split: Hypertrophy/strength routine
* Progressive overload by increasing reps within rep range and weight once rep range surpassed. Keep same number of sets during meso cycle and same RIR (two reps in reserve)
* 250-500 cal surplus
* Gain between 0.5% and 0.25% bodyweight per week
* Drop 20% of weight if stalled or deload week if too fatigued
* Focus on hypetrophy, mobility and tendons

* freekick
* stretch


### Solo Football practice template 2

* Side to side (with band) and isometric (wall sit and glute bridge against goal post)
* Low level plyometrics
* Squash court L keep ups
* Stretch

### 10 min per tendon Plyometrics workout (with progression)
* 1h before exercise 15 gr of collagen/gelatine (4 blue scoops) and 50mg of vitamin c (one orange)
* Isometrics can have an analgesic effect (no pain) for 45 minutes (that's why it makes sense to start the training session with them)
* Start with 2-4 sets of 45 seconds isometrics
  * Spanish squat
  * 15-30sec single leg isometrics, single leg spanish squat or single leg legpress. Work up to 2x 30sec x 4.
* after the iso 10 min plyo 
* Then FULL ROM lifts
* In winter do them on hard court, in summer on sand
* Goal is to increase volume by 5% each week
* Start with ACL rehab program 3x a week https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24vTemdHiqY&ab_channel=E3Rehab
* Then add "cool" exercises and ACL rehab exercises "variants"
  * Band assisted jumps pogo jumps (quick bounce)
  * drop jumps (eccentric bounce)
  * max jumps (concentric jumps)
  * Lateral jumps

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6p9o93z5QQ


### 30 min Sand plyometrics
* Frog jumps
* Sprints
* Lateral sprints
* Lateral single leg hops

## To do
* Write down ACL plyometrics
* Recepies blog (with macros and micros)
* Watch all YT videos linked in this post
* Write down tendon properties (and image)
* Write down plyo programs (ACL, preseason, in season, hardcourt / sand)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtPpQgzT3XU&ab_channel=Plyomorph
