## Network Performance Metrics
### Byte conversion
* bit = just one binary digit
* ASCII character = 7 bits, often stored in 8 bits
* \\(Byte=8\ bits\\)
* The size of a `word` depends on the architecture you're working in. In `x86 assembly language`, regardless of the machine word size:
  *  `WORD` = 2 bytes
  *  `long` (doubleworld: `DWORD`) = 4 bytes
  *  `QUADWORD` (`QWORD`) = 8 bytes  are used for 2, 4 and 8 byte sizes.
*  char = 1 byte
*  short = 2 bytes
*  int = 32 bytes
*  long = 64 bytes
*  float = 32 bytes
*  double = 64 bytes 
* \\(KB=2^{10}\ bytes\\)
* \\(MB=2^{20}\ bytes\\)
* \\(GB=2^{30}\ bytes\\)
* \\(TB=2^{40}\ bytes\\) 
* frame: m data bits + r redunancy check bits
  * codeword: n-bit unit containing 1 frame. where n = m + r
  * corate: fraction of the codeword that is not redundant: m/n

### Speed
* Bandwidth: **Amount of total data that can maximally be sent via a connection per time unit**. (Max throughput) i.e. 10MB/s
* Latency: **bit travel time** from A to B. i.e. 20ms
* file transmission time (i.e. ms): **Time it takes to send all** bits of the message: (buffer) + file size / transmission rate 
  * Transmission rate: **sent bits per unit of time** (usually the bandwidth or smaller)
* Packet Delivery Time (ms): file transmission time + latency
* Throughput (**data transmitted per unit** i.e. 5 MB/s): file size / packet delivery time
* Overhead percentage: supportive info/total data
  * Total data = goodput + supportive info
  * goodput: actual data
* Packet loss is associated with a probaiblity p
* Jitter: variance in transmission delay (in latency)
  * Data might have been lost and resent without it being apparent to the user in anything but jitter. 

## Bitwise operations

### display the integers as a binary string
* Java:
```java
Long.toBinaryString(6) => "110"
```

* Python:
```python
format(6, 'b') => '110'
```

### Selecting
* To select parts of a binary sequence you can make use of bit masks. A bit mask is a binary sequence with 1s in the positions that are to be selected. This bit mask is then bitwise-AND'ed with the binary sequence. For example:
```
10110110 (input) AND 11110000 (mask) => 10110000
```

### Moving
* To move the selected part left or right in the sequence, bitwise-shifts can be used. A shift moves the entire sequence left or right depending on the chosen operator. For example:
```
10110110 LEFT_SHIFT 1  => 101101100
10110110 LEFT_SHIFT 2  => 1011011000
10110110 RIGHT_SHIFT 1 => 01011011
10110110 RIGHT_SHIFT 4 => 00001011
```

* Be careful when shifting numbers by more than 32 steps. This will overflow if the number is not a 64-bit integer
Combining
To combine multiple bit sequences, a bitwise-OR can be used. For example:
```
10110000 OR 00000110 => 10110110
```

### Length
* To calculate the length of the binary sequence (measured from the highest 1 bit), you can make use of:
* Generic:
```
floor(log2(10110110)) + 1 => 8
```
* Java:
```java
long bitSequence = Long.parseLong("10110110", 2)
Math.floor(Math.log(bitSequence)/ Math.log(2)) + 1 => 8
```
* Python:
```python
bit_sequence = int('10110110', 2)
bit_sequence.bit_length() => 8
```

### Bitcount
* To calculate the amount of 1s in a binary sequence, you can make use of:
* Generic:
```
bit_count(integer)
count = 0
while int
  count += (int AND 1)
  int = int RIGHT_SHIFT 1
return count
```
* Java:
```java
long bit_sequence = Long.parseLong("110", 2)
Long.bitCount(bit_sequence) => 2
```
* Python:
```python
bit_sequence = int('110', 2)
bit_count(6) => 2
```

### Java operators
* bitwise and: &
* bitwise or: \|
* bitwise XOR*: ^ (it's a binary sum without carry over)
* bitwise compliment: ~
* left shift: <<
* right shift: >>

### Java methods
```java
private static void debugging() {
    // Showing binary representation of an integer value for debugging:
    long integerNotation = 6;
    String binaryStringNotation = Long.toBinaryString(integerNotation);
    System.out.println(integerNotation + " -> " + binaryStringNotation);
  }

  private static void binaryNotation() {
    // Creating integer from binary notation:
    long integer1 = Long.parseLong("110", 2);
    // Add L on the end for values larger than 32-bit
    long integer2 = 0b110;
    System.out.println(integer1);
    System.out.println(integer2);
  }

  private static void createBitSequence() {
    // Creating 010110001 (bit sequences) from scratch
    long res = 0;
    // or res = res | (1L << 7)
    res |= 1L << 7;
    res |= 1L << 5;
    res |= 1L << 4;
    res |= 1L;
    System.out.println(Long.toBinaryString(res));
  }

  private static void flippingBit() {
    // Flipping a bit in 10(1)1 to become 10(0)1
    long unflipped = 0b1011;
    // XOR original value with 10
    long flipped = unflipped ^ (1L << 1);
    System.out.println(Long.toBinaryString(unflipped) + " -> " + Long.toBinaryString(flipped));
  }

    long prependee = 0b101;
    long prepended = original | (prependee << 7);
    System.out.println(Long.toBinaryString(original) + " -> " + Long.toBinaryString(prepended));
  }

  private static void appending() {
    // Appending the bit sequence 01110001 with 011

    long unchanged = 0b1101011;
    long newValue = 0b100;
    // Create a mask that selects the parts that need to remain
    long mask = 0b1100011;
    // Clear part to be changed
    long changed = unchanged & mask;
    // Apply new value
    changed |= (newValue << 2);
    System.out.println(Long.toBinaryString(unchanged) + " -> " + Long.toBinaryString(changed));
  }

  private static void inserting() {
    // Inserting a '1' in between bit sequence 110011010 to become 110(1)011010
    long uninserted = 0b110011010;
    // Mask to select first part
    long mask1 = 0b111000000;
    // Mask to select second part
    long mask2 = 0b000111111;
    // Create a gap
    long tmp1 = ((mask1 & uninserted) << 1) | (mask2 & uninserted);
    // Add the value 1000000
    long inserted = tmp1 | (1L << 6);
    System.out.println(Long.toBinaryString(uninserted) + " -> " + Long.toBinaryString(inserted));
  }
```

## Network Layers
![layers]({{ site.url }}/images/network_layers.png)
* Each layer is a "level of abstraction"
  * Provides "services" to the layers above and below
  * Create the illusion of direct communication (horizontal line between same level layers), but in reality the information goes down from the origin up to the destination
![illusion]({{ site.url }}/images/illusion_direct_communication.png)
  * Only the lowest layer is the one that does the actual communication
  * Middle layers on different machines can have totally different service implementations, we dont care as long as the message is unchanged

### Open Systems Interconnections (OSI) Model
* This "model" divides the internet to diverse protocols (illusory direct communication between layers)
  * Each protocol is assigned to each layer

1. **Physical Layer** (lowest layer): Sends one bit via a physical medium, called a link
  * such physical medium can be an (ethernet) cable or a Wifi frequency
2. **Data link layer**: Sends a sequence of bits over a link *reliably*.
  * The pysical layer has a lot of errors (1 gets flipped into a 0 or viceversa or some data is lost during transmission). This layer deals with these errors so that the next layer doesnt even notice them.
    * **The MAC-Sublayer** regulates shared access to a (physical) medium, such as a wifi router. When multiple users are using a router, this sublayer manages how it is shared so that everybody can use it in a fair manner. MAC = medium access control
3. **Network layer**: Such as a LAN network or even the entire internet. This layer executes the sending of data from a source to a destination, which might be on the same network or on a different network.
4. **Transport layer**: The network layer has similar problems as the physical layer, where data is corrupted or lost, but at a higher level (i.e. sockets rather than single bits). This layer manages these problems and either decides to fix them or to ignore them (such as in a live videocall, where you do not want longer delays and rather have a potato but fast frames per second rather than HD frames per minute...). This is layer and upward ones only exist on the end hosts machines (i.e. the router has no longer nothing to do with). Therefore the source and destination only receive inderect feedback in the form of whether the packages have been received or not.
5. **Aplication layer** (highest level): These are protocols that deal with sending application specific information (email, web, instant messaging, games...)
  * The original OSI model actually has 2 additional layers between transport and application layer (5. Session and 6. Pressentation), but have no dedicated protocols and in practice the roles of these layers have been merged into either transport or application layers.
![communication]({{ site.url }}/images/communication_between_machines.png)
* Host stands for both source and destination parties
  * The data that a host sends is first forwared to the lowest layers on its machine (network, data link, physical)
  * Each of these apply some "preparing" tasks if needed, then send to the router, which then sends the data to another router (who may send it to another one and so on until reaching the destination router), who will pump the information up to the higher layers who will forward it to the correct application layer. (i.e. whatsapp messages should be sent to the whatsapp app used by the phone with the corresponding local IP address)

### TCP/IP model
* Whereas the OSI model (especially the original one that included Session and Presnetation) is a platonic model of what the ideal communication layers would look like, the TCP/IP model looked at the protocols that exist in practice and based on the ones being used it came up with:
![tcpip]({{ site.url }}/images/tcpip.png)
* It is practically the same but it officially removes the presentation and session layers, renames Network for Internet, and merges Data link and Pysical into Host-to-network (sometimes called the link layer). The reason of the merging is because even though OSI initially let each layer to be implemented independently, the wifi (pyhisical) was so irreliable that it was easier to enforce that all wifi layers are uniformly consistent with the data link layer so that errors are more intuitive and easier to handle.

![protocols]({{ site.url }}/images/protocols.png)

* TCP is reliable and connection-oriented
* TCP handles flow control
* UDP is unreliable and connection-less oriented

## Error Detection
### Parity bits and checksums
* Checks for errors in the network. Possible causes are:
  * Errors between the client side wifi router and the machine
  * Errors in one of the multiple wifi routers on the server side
* Possible types of errors:
  * Bit could be flipped
    * Bit flip algorithms
  * Truncated/lost bits
    * Solution: Sender and reciver keep track of how much quantity they have sent and received

### Error Detection
1. Receipient detects an error
2. Recipient tells sender that error has been found, requests resend
3. Sender has to resend the data

### Error correction
1. Recepitent detects an error
2. Recipient is smart enough to fix it on its own

Both detection and correction are only possible by adding extra information to the messages which can allow to detect for errors.

Detection increasesy accuracy but increases latency and band-width usage whereas correction does the opposite.

* Just detection and request retransmission is preferred over cable connections as the the errors appear much less frequently than in wifi connections and the occasional double request is offset by having less overhead.
* For wireless connections errors are much more frequent and double-requests would be too expensive, therefore error-correction is prefrerred.

### Parity bits
* A binary sequence has either even or odd parity (if it has an even/odd number of 1s)
* Parity bit algorithm: Sender and receiver agree on a fixed parity for all messages
  * Sender adds bit to message to get desired parity (appended to the right)
  * If parity is different then message must have been corrupted (however, keeping the same parity does not guarantee a successful message)
  * Algorithm can only detect odd number of bit flips

### Checksum
* Divides bits into groups of k-bits. Assume k=4.
* Computes the binary sum (bitwise xor) of all the blocks (last carried over bit is ignored)
* Appends the sum to the recepient
* The bitwise sum of the recepient which includes the appended sum should be all zeros (111 XOR 111 = 000), if not, then there was an error

### Checksum in 1s complement
* It's the same but in the XOR addition a row of all 1's is also added such that the appended checksum, when added to all the other k-sized blocks, returns all 1's instead of all 0's


### Hamming distance
To be able to detect or correct an error in a transmission, the data needs to have redundant information. This extra data can be used by the receiver to check if the original data has changed during the transmission and possibly correct the error. A piece of data together with its redundant information is called a codeword. Given an algorithm for computing the (redundant) check bits, it is possible to construct a set of all valid codewords, which is called a code.

**The Hamming distance is used to count the number of bit positions that two codewords differ.** To compute the Hamming distance of an entire code, you need to find **the smallest Hamming distance between all combinations of valid codewords in the code**.

For example:
```
Code = {0000, 0011, 1100, 1111}
distance(0000, 0011) = 2
distance(0000, 1100) = 2
distance(0000, 1111) = 4
distance(0011, 1100) = 4
distance(0011, 1111) = 2
distance(1100, 1111) = 2
```
Therefore Hamming Distance = 2



The error-detecting and error-correcting properties of a code depend on its Hamming distance. **To reliably detect d errors, you need a code with a minimal distance of `d + 1`** because with such a code there is no way that d single-bit errors can change a valid codeword into another valid codeword. When the receiver sees an illegal codeword, it can tell that a transmission error has occurred.

Similarly, **to correct d errors, you need a code with a minimal distance of `2d + 1`**. If all legal codewords differ in at least `2d + 1` bits, a codeword with at most d changes is still closer to the original codeword than any other codeword. This means the original codeword can be uniquely determined based on the assumption that d is in indeed the maximal number of errors.

* The number of bits in a codeword is case specific and may or **may not** have the same number of bits as an assembly `WORD`.

```java
class HammingDistance {

  /**
   * Calculates the hamming distance of the given code, or returns -1 if it cannot be calculated.
   *
   * @param code The code, consisting out of a list of codewords
   * @return The hamming distance of the given code , or -1 if it cannot be calculated
   */
  static long calculate(List<Long> code) {
    Long min = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    

  for (Long currentWord : code){
    for (Long otherWord : code){
        if (currentWord != otherWord){
                long xor = currentWord ^ otherWord;
                long count = Long.bitCount(xor);
          if (count < min){
            min=count;
          }
        }
    }
  }
  return min == Long.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : min;
  }
}
```

### Cyclic Redunancy Check (CRC)
* Long division with remainder for binary numbers Uses a polynomial interpretation for each of the digits of a number, therefore there is like addition with no carryover (at all)
  * \\(x^3+x^2+x+1\\)

![binary_division]({{ site.url }}/images/binary_division.png)
* The data is the numerator and "error" is the denominator (different errors can find different amount of flipped bits)
  * CRC cannot detect any errors where the error is a multiple of generator
* The error denominator (aka generator) is chosen such that the remainder is 0
* When the receiver computes the division, if the remainder is not zero then it has detected an error
* There can be undetected errors if the changed bits come from the data + multiple of error

![crc_fn]({{ site.url }}/images/crc_fn.png)

* CRC is a very common error detection scheme, which is used in the Ethernet protocol
* it’s not secure against deliberate attacks
* If we want to send our own sequence of bits, just divide it by the generator and append the result to the right of your sequence
  * Keep in mind that you have to append 0's always to the bit sequence before dividing it such that the appended block length is equal to the number of bits in the generator - 1. These appended bits are called "frame check sequence".

```python
from library import bit_count

class CRC:

    @staticmethod
    def calculate(bit_sequence: int, input_length: int, generator_sequence: int) -> int:
        """
        Calculates the CRC check value.

        :param bit_sequence: The input bit sequence.
        :param input_length:  The length of the input bit sequence (including possible leading zeros).
        :param generator_sequence: The generator bit sequence.
        :return: The CRC check value.
        """
        
        gen_length = len(format(generator_sequence, "b"))
        
        bit_sequence <<= gen_length - 1
        input_length += gen_length - 1
        
        for shift in range(input_length - 1, gen_length - 2, -1):
            print(format(bit_sequence, "b").zfill(input_length))
            if bit_sequence >> shift:
                bit_sequence ^= generator_sequence << (shift - gen_length + 1)
        
        return bit_sequence


    @staticmethod
    def check(bit_sequence: int, input_length: int, generator_sequence: int, check_sequence: int) -> bool:
        """

        :param bit_sequence: The CRC bit sequence excluding the CRC check value
        :param input_length: The length of the input bit sequence (including possible leading zeros)
        :param generator_sequence: The generator bit sequence used
        :param check_sequence: The CRC check value to check against
        :return: True if the sequence is correct, False otherwise
        """
        
        return CRC.calculate(bit_sequence, input_length, generator_sequence) == check_sequence
```

### Hamming code (n+k,n)
<iframe width="100%" height="415" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/373FUw-2U2k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
* Like the previous techniques were extra bits provide information that allows an algorithm to correct certain errors. Hamming Codes have two numbers:
  * n: bit length of the original data/message (d3 = data bit 1)
  * k: number of extra bits and their parity (the size of k is determined by n) (p1 = parity of slot 1)

Example: 10011010

a. Sender allocates n+k slots and enamurate the slots from the left starting at 1.

| p1| p2| d3| p4| d5| d6| d7| p8| d9|d10|d11|d12|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

b. The sender copies the n-bit message into slots that are NOT powers of two.

| p1| p2| d3| p4| d5| d6| d7| p8| d9|d10|d11|d12|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   | 1 |   | 0 | 0 | 1 |   | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

c. The other slots have the parity of a sequence of bits, depending on the position of the parity bit.
   *  p1 checks the parity of odd numbers, and converts itself to 1 or 0 to keep the XOR sum = 0
      *  p1+1+0+1+1+1=p1+0, p1=0

| p1| p2| d3| p4| d5| d6| d7| p8| d9|d10|d11|d12|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 |   | 1 |   | 0 | 0 | 1 |   | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

  * p2 checks 2 bits, skip 2 bits, formally checks the parity of binary numbers whose second bit is "ON", i.e. 00**1**0,00**1**1,01**1**0,01**1**1,10**1**0,10**1**1,11**1**0,11**1**1=(2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15)
    * p2 = p2+1+0+1+0+1=p2+1,p2=1

| p1| p2| d3| p4| d5| d6| d7| p8| d9|d10|d11|d12|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |   | 0 | 0 | 1 |   | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

  * pn checks the parity of binary numbers whose k bit is "ON"...
  * p4 is k-bit number 3, so 100,101... =  4,5,6,7,12,13,14,15
    * p4+0+0+1+0=p4+1,p4=1

| p1| p2| d3| p4| d5| d6| d7| p8| d9|d10|d11|d12|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |   | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

   * p8 is k-bit number 4 so 8-15, 24-31...

| p1| p2| d3| p4| d5| d6| d7| p8| d9|d10|d11|d12|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

d. Receiver flips those bits whose parity doesnt match
* error at d10

| p1| p2| d3| p4| d5| d6| d7| p8| d9|d10|d11|d12|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | **1** | 1 | 0 |

* Manually check the parity of all parity bits again
  * p2 is flipped
  * p8 is also fipped
  * 2+8=10, d10 is the bad bit

### Parity block
#### Sender
* Arrange the message in r by c bits matrix
* Compute the parity bits for all rows and columns respectively
* The corner bit is the parity of all bits, it has the same parity as the row and the column parity bits

![parity_block]({{ site.url }}/images/parity_block.png)
#### Receiver
* Assumes there was at most one bit flip
* Computes the parity bits for all rows and columns and finds the coordinates of the flipped bit and flips it

![fix_block]({{ site.url }}/images/fix_block.png)

* We can use the column/rows bit and corner bit to check if the flip was in the appended parity bits rather than in the data. These may be fixed depending on whether we forward these parity bits or not.

### Overhead Analysis
* Overhead: amount of extra information required by protocol in comparision to actual data
  * If for 100byte of data you have 1byte of appended information then you have a 1% overhead with O(n)
* Parity blocks have an overhead of r+c+1 bits
* Use derivative to minimize overhead

![fix_block]({{ site.url }}/images/overhead.png)

* This has asymptotic complexity of \\(O\sqrt{n}\\)
* Hamming Code has n+k bits overhead
* The asymptotic complexity is \\(O(log(n))\\)

![fix_block]({{ site.url }}/images/hc_overhead.png)

* Both parityblocks and hamming code can only correct 1 bit flip. There are other algorithms that can flip more bits, but none of the standard network protocols use them.

### Burst Errors
* Errors typically occur in bursts, so if one bit is flippied there is a high probability the next one is flipped as well
* We can mitigate error bursts by arranging the data in columns and rows and assigning a sepearate hamming code algorithm to teach column and row, which then only has to handle 1 flipped bit at a time

## Services
![service]({{ site.url }}/images/service.png)
* Ethernet does not provide reliable communication (acknowledged).
  * It is up to higher protocol levels to recover from this problem.
* In real-life application unreliable communication is prefered because of speed and flow
* For file transfer reliable is imprescindible.

### Connection-Oriented service
* Communication between layers based on the telephone system. To talk
to someone, you pick up the phone, dial the number, talk, and then hang up.
 * To use a connection-oriented network service, the service user first establishes
a connection, uses the connection, and then releases the connection.
* The
essential aspect of a connection is that it acts like a tube: the sender pushes objects
(bits) in at one end, and the receiver takes them out at the other end.
* In some cases when a connection is established, the sender, receiver, and subnet
conduct a negotiation about the parameters to be used, such as maximum
message size, quality of service required, and other issues.
* Typically, one side
makes a proposal and the other side can accept it, reject it, or make a counterproposal.
* A circuit is another name for a connection with associated resources,
such as a fixed bandwidth.

### Connectionless service
* Communication between layers based on the postal system.
* Message carries full destination address
* each one is routed through the intermediate nodes inside the system independent
of all the subsequent messages
  * a packet is a message at the network layer.
    * When the intermediate
    nodes receive a message in full before sending it on to the next node, this
    is called store-and-forward switching. The alternative, in which the onward
    transmission of a message at a node starts before it is completely received by the
    node, is called cut-through switching. Normally, when two messages are sent to
    the same destination, the first one sent will be the first one to arrive. However, it
    is possible that the first one sent can be delayed so that the second one arrives
    first.

### Reliable service
* having the receiver acknowledge the receipt of each message
so the sender is sure that it arrived. The acknowledgement process introduces
overhead and delays, which are often worth it but are sometimes undesirable.

### Connectionless application
* All that is needed is a way to send a single message that has high probability of arrival but no guarantee nor acknoweldge is returned to the sender. This is often called a datagram service.

### Acknowledged datagram
* acknowledged
datagram service can be provided for these applications. It is like sending a registered
letter and requesting a return receipt.
* When the receipt comes back, the
sender is absolutely sure that the letter was delivered to the intended party and not
lost along the way.
* Text messaging on mobile phones is an example.

### Request-reply service
* In this service the sender
transmits a single datagram containing a request; the reply contains the answer.
Request-reply is commonly used to implement communication in the client-server
model
  * the client issues a request and the server responds to it.

## Data link layer
* The data link layer uses the services of the physical layer to send and receive
bits over communication channels. It has a number of functions, including
  1. Providing a well-defined service interface to the network layer.
  2. Dealing with transmission errors.
  3. Regulating the flow of data so that slow receivers are not swamped
by fast senders.
* To accomplish these goals, the data link layer takes the packets it gets from the
network layer and encapsulates them into frames for transmission. Each frame
contains a frame header, a payload field for holding the packet, and a frame
trailer.

![frame]({{ site.url }}/images/frame.png)

### Services Provided to the Network layer
* The function of the data link layer is to provide services to the network layer.
  * transferring data from the network layer on the source machine
to the network layer on the destination machine

#### Unacknowledged connectionless service
* having the source machine
send independent frames to the destination machine without having the
destination machine acknowledge them. suchas Ethernet.
* No logical connection is established beforehand
or released afterward.

#### acknowledged connectionless service
* there are still no logical connections used, but
each frame sent is individually acknowledged.
* the sender knows
whether a frame has arrived correctly or been lost. If it has not arrived within a
specified time interval, it can be sent again. This service is useful over unreliable
channels, such as wireless systems. 802.11 (WiFi) is a good example of this class
of service.
* On
reliable channels, such as fiber, the overhead of a heavyweight data link protocol
may be unnecessary, but on (inherently unreliable) wireless channels it is well
worth the cost.

#### connection-oriented service
* the source and destination machines establish a connection before any data are
transferred.
* Each frame sent over the connection is numbered, and the data link
layer guarantees that each frame sent is indeed received.
* it guarantees
that each frame is received exactly once and that all frames are received in
the right order
* provides the network layer processes
with the equivalent of a reliable bit stream.
* transfers go through three distinct
phases:
  * In the first phase, the connection is established by having both sides initialize
variables and counters needed to keep track of which frames have been received
and which ones have not.
  * In the second phase, one or more frames are actually
transmitted.
  * In the third and final phase, the connection is released, freeing
up the variables, buffers, and other resources used to maintain the connection.

## Data link layer framing
* The main responsibility of the data link layer is to provide reliable transport of bits.
  * To achieve that it uses error detection or error correction
    * You dont apply that on the entire file, you do it in "frames"

![frame2.png]({{ site.url }}/images/frame2.png)

* Ethernet damaged cables have occasional data loss just as wifi connected devices far from the wifi range.

### How to determine start of a frame
* Break between frames
  * But: telling breaks from lost bits is impossible & several parties using the medium can cause interference and mask breaks.
* Fixed length frames
  * But hard to tell which frame is damaged

Therefore:
1. Only rely on data rather than on assumptions about speific properties of the medium (such as ability to detect breaks)
2. Use an algorithm so that data loss only has consequences for the affected frames

#### Byte Stuffing: Flag determines beginning and end of the frame.

![bs3.png]({{ site.url }}/images/bs3.png)

![bs4.png]({{ site.url }}/images/bs4.png)

* Escape byte is a byte that indicates that next byte should be treated like normal data and not as a special character.
  * The escape byte also needs to be escaped

![bs5.png]({{ site.url }}/images/bs5.png)

![bs6.png]({{ site.url }}/images/bs6.png)

* Disadvantage: a lot of overhead due to escape bytes

* Alternative, Bit stuffing:

![bs8.png]({{ site.url }}/images/bs8.png)

#### Dealing with lost frames: Automatic Repeat ReQuest (ARQ) for noisy channel uses acknowledgement
  * Receiver acknowledges frames that are correctly delivered
  * Sender sets timer and resends frame if no ack
  * If there is no acknowledgement (timeout) then sends the frame again
  * It can be the rare case when there is no acknowledgement wihin the timout but it has indeed been sent (it's just slow) then you'd have a duplicated frame

![arq.png]({{ site.url }}/images/arq.png)

* Frames and acknowledgements must be numbered to fix the duplicated issue
* The problem of sop and wait is that it wastes a lot of bandwidth by waiting

#### Sliding windows
* The technique of temporarily delaying
outgoing acknowledgements so that they can be hooked onto the next outgoing
data frame is known as piggybacking.
The principal advantage of using piggybacking over having distinct acknowledgement
frames is a better use of the available channel bandwidth.
* This is something different to the images below, what it means is that in a 2-way communication where A and B both are poractively talking, instead of wasting one dummy frame for just the ack, add the ack into the header of the next frame containing real data.
* However If the data link layer waits longer
than the sender’s timeout period, the frame will be retransmitted, defeating the
whole purpose of having acknowledgements.
* Therefore, If
a new packet will be sent quickly, the acknowledgement is piggybacked onto it.
Otherwise, if no new packet will be sent by the end of this time period, the data
link layer just sends a separate acknowledgement frame.

Real sliding windows:

* The essence of all sliding window protocols is that at any instant of time, the
sender maintains a set of sequence numbers corresponding to frames it is permitted
to send.
  * These frames are said to fall within the sending window.
  * Similarly,
the receiver also maintains a receiving window corresponding to the set of frames
it is permitted to accept.
* Since frames currently within the sender’s window may ultimately be lost or
damaged in transit, the sender must keep all of these frames in its memory for
possible retransmission. Thus, if the maximum window size is n, the sender needs
n buffers to hold the unacknowledged frames

## MAC Sublayer
* The main purpose of the MAC Sublayer is to allow multiple parties to share a medium or a small local network.

### Channel allocation protocols
*  protocols run on the sender side that determine when it's the sender's turn to use a shared medium.

### ALOHA
* Users transmit frames whenever they have data
* if collision occurs, retry after a random delay
* does not scale well

![aloha.PNG]({{ site.url }}/images/aloha.PNG)

### Carrier-Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
* Senders can detect (sense) if the channel is in use
  * 1-persisten: wait for idle, then send
  * Nonpersistent: if busy, wait random amount of time and try again
  * p-persistent: if busy, wait for next slot, if idle, send with probability p

### 1-persistent
![1p.PNG]({{ site.url }}/images/1p.PNG)

* problem: if parties send it at the exact same time, they will resend at same time and have collision again.

### Nonpersistent CSMA
![np.PNG]({{ site.url }}/images/np.PNG)

* instead of immedeatly resending, it randomly waits before sending again.
* problem: the channel is unitilized often

### p-persistent
* compromise between 1-persistent and nonpersistent
* the higher the p, the closer it gets to 1-persistent (higher probability of collisions)

![pp.PNG]({{ site.url }}/images/pp.PNG)

### Channel utilization comparision
* As the load increases the utilization of the channel decreases due to an increased collision probability (poisson distributed)

![ch.PNG]({{ site.url }}/images/ch.PNG)

* Being greedy gives good performance under low load
* Being generous gives good performance under high load
