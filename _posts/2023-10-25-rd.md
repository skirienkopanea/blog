## Run this code

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt -y install xfce4
sudo apt-get install xrdp
sudo cp /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini.bak
sudo sed -i 's/3389/3390/g' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
sudo sed -i 's/max_bpp=32/#max_bpp=32\nmax_bpp=128/g' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
sudo sed -i 's/xserverbpp=24/#xserverbpp=24\nxserverbpp=128/g' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
sudo /etc/init.d/xrdp start
```

Now you can log into it locally if you connect via Remote Desktop to `localhost:3390`.

To allow other computers in your network to log into them, because it-s wsl2, you need to forward the connecton to the IP of the linux machine.

In linux run `hostname -i` and that address is the one that you'll use for the following command in the windows machine:

```shell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3390 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=3390 connectaddress=172.31.78.193
```

Make sure your laptop is discoverable in the network. Then you can log in via remote desktop from another computer in the same network by accessing to its local ip address.

To do so go to Advanced Firewall settings and create an inbound rule for port 3390 TCP that allows Private connections(make sure that the wifi is set to be a private network in both machines).

## Troubleshooting

Me: `xrdp Error message after login with username and password`

ChatGPT said:


When using xrdp to connect to an Ubuntu server, you may encounter errors after entering your username and password. This can be due to various reasons, such as missing desktop environments, incorrect configurations, or permission issues. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve common issues with xrdp:
Step 1: Check the xrdp-sesman Log

The first step in troubleshooting is to check the log files for xrdp and xrdp-sesman, as they can provide detailed error messages.

```bash

sudo cat /var/log/xrdp-sesman.log
```

Me:
```txt

```

Chat GPT:

The log you provided indicates that the X server starts but then exits quickly, which suggests that there might be a problem with the window manager configuration or that the required desktop environment isn't properly configured.

Here are steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### 1. **Check if a Desktop Environment is Installed**
Make sure that you have a desktop environment installed. Xfce is a common choice for `xrdp` because it is lightweight and works well with remote desktop sessions.

To install Xfce:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies -y
```

### 2. **Configure `xrdp` to Use Xfce**
If you're using Xfce, you need to configure `xrdp` to use it:

1. Create or edit the `~/.xsession` file in the user's home directory:

   ```bash
   echo "xfce4-session" > ~/.xsession
   ```

2. Make sure that the `~/.xsession` file is readable by the user:

   ```bash
   chmod 644 ~/.xsession
   ```

3. Restart the `xrdp` service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart xrdp
   ```

### 3. **Verify the Window Manager Configuration**
The log mentions that the window manager exited quickly, which might indicate a misconfiguration.

To use Xfce with `xrdp`, ensure that `/etc/xrdp/startwm.sh` correctly calls the Xfce session:

1. Edit `/etc/xrdp/startwm.sh`:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh
   ```

2. Comment out the last two lines:

   ```bash
   #. /etc/X11/Xsession
   #startxfce4
   ```

3. Add the following line before the script exits:

   ```bash
   startxfce4
   ```

4. Save the file and exit the editor (`Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

5. Restart the `xrdp` service again:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart xrdp
   ```

### 4. **Check Permissions**
Ensure that your home directory and any relevant configuration files have the correct permissions:

1. Check ownership and permissions of your home directory:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /home/$USER
   ```

2. Ensure that `.Xauthority` has the correct ownership:

   ```bash
   sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.Xauthority
   ```

### 5. **Check Logs Again After Changes**
If you continue to encounter issues, check the logs again after making these changes:

- `/var/log/xrdp-sesman.log`
- `/var/log/xrdp.log`

Look for any new errors or warnings that might provide further clues.

### 6. **Consider Trying Another Desktop Environment**
If Xfce doesn't work or if you prefer another desktop environment, you can try installing GNOME or another lightweight desktop environment like LXDE or MATE.

For example, to install MATE:

```bash
sudo apt install ubuntu-mate-core -y
```

Then update your `~/.xsession` or `/etc/xrdp/startwm.sh` to start the MATE session.

### Summary
- Ensure a desktop environment (like Xfce) is installed.
- Configure `xrdp` to start the correct window manager.
- Verify and fix file permissions.
- Check logs for further issues.

These steps should help resolve the issues you're facing with `xrdp` and allow you to establish a successful remote session.
