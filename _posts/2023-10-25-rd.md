## Run this code

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt -y install xfce4
sudo apt-get install xrdp
sudo cp /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini.bak
sudo sed -i 's/3389/3390/g' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
sudo sed -i 's/max_bpp=32/#max_bpp=32\nmax_bpp=128/g' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
sudo sed -i 's/xserverbpp=24/#xserverbpp=24\nxserverbpp=128/g' /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
sudo /etc/init.d/xrdp start
```

Now you can log into it locally if you connect via Remote Desktop to `localhost:3390`.

To allow other computers in your network to log into them, because it-s wsl2, you need to forward the connecton to the IP of the linux machine.

In linux run `hostname -i` and that address is the one that you'll use for the following command in the windows machine:

```shell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3390 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=3390 connectaddress=172.31.78.193
```

Make sure your laptop is discoverable in the network. Then you can log in via remote desktop from another computer in the same network by accessing to its local ip address.

To do so go to Advanced Firewall settings and create an inbound rule for port 3390 TCP that allows Private connections(make sure that the wifi is set to be a private network in both machines).
