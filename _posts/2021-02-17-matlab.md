## Solve augmented matrix

Use A for the coefficient matrix and B for the augmented column:

```matlab
>> A=[1 2 -3; 0 1 -3; -3 -5 7]

A =

     1     2    -3
     0     1    -3
    -3    -5     7

>> B=[-2; -5; 3]

B =

    -2
    -5
     3

>> c = linsolve(A,B)

c =

    2.0000
    1.0000
    2.0000
```

## Return eigenvalues D and eigenvectors V

Where D represents \\(\Lambda\\) and V represents \\(S\\). Matlab seems to present the eigenvalues in ascending order and S columns will be sorted accordingly.

```matlab
>> A=[.5 .4; -.104 1.1]

A =

    0.5000    0.4000
   -0.1040    1.1000

>> [V,D] = eig(A)

V =

   -0.9806   -0.6097
   -0.1961   -0.7926


D =

    0.5800         0
         0    1.0200

>> 
```

## Scale eigenvectors
* Matlab will provide normalized eigenvectors that have magnitude 1 (sum the squares of all the entries in a column of a 2 by 2 matrix and you get 1). To "normalize" it in a way that the first entry row is 1 we can divide each vector by it's first element, which is vectorized using `bsxfun(@rdivide, V, V(1,:))`. Hopefully we got rid of long decimals and can use the basic calculator to figure out whole number columns.

## Transpose

```matlab
B = transpose(A)
B = A.'
```

## Vector length

```matlab
n = norm(v)
```

## Matrix multiplication

```matlab
C = mtimes(A,B)
```
* also works with just *

## Matrix sum
```matlab
S = sum(A)
```

## Matlab comments

```matlab
%{
   Comment
   block
%}
% comment line
```

## Inverse matrix
```matlab
S=inv(A)
%or
S=A^(-1)
```

## Identity Matrix
```matlab
I = eye(n) %returns an n-by-n identity matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
I = eye(n,m) %returns an n-by-m matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
```

## Zero matrix
```matlab
O = zeros(n) %returns an n-by-n matrix of zeros.
O = zeros(n,m) %returns an n-by-m matrix of zeros.
```

## Row reduced echelon form
```matlab
R = rref(A) %returns the reduced row echelon form of A using Gauss-Jordan elimination with partial pivoting.
```

## Normalize columns of matrix
```
N=normc(M) %normalizes the columns of M to a length of 1.
```
