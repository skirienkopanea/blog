# Configuring a Systemd Service for a Flask Python Application in Production

Deploying a Flask application in a production environment necessitates a rigorous configuration to ensure both reliability and security. This guide elucidates the process of configuring a Flask application as a systemd service on a Linux server, utilizing Gunicorn as the production WSGI server, and establishing the necessary network configurations for external access.

## Step 1: Environment Preparation and Installation

Begin by ensuring that your Flask application is properly deployed and that a virtual environment is established.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv /path/to/your/venv
   ```
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```sh
   source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install Flask and Gunicorn**:
   ```sh
   pip install flask gunicorn
   ```

## Step 2: Create and Configure the Systemd Service File

To deploy the Flask application as a service, a systemd service file must be created and appropriately configured:

1. **Create the Service File**:
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/flask_app.service
   ```
2. **Define the Service Configuration**:
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Flask Application
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=myuser
   WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/flask_app
   ExecStart=/home/sergio/venv/bin/gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5000 api:app
   Restart=always
   Environment="PATH=/home/sergio/venv/bin"

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
   - Replace `/home/sergio/venv` with the appropriate path to your virtual environment.
   - Replace `/path/to/your/flask_app` with the correct path to your Flask application directory.
   - Replace `api:app` with the appropriate filename (`api.py`) and the Flask instance (`app`).
   - Replace `myuser` with the intended user account that should execute the service.

## Step 3: Reload Systemd and Initiate the Service

1. **Reload the systemd daemon** to incorporate the new service file:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
2. **Enable the Service** to start automatically upon system boot:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable flask_app.service
   ```
3. **Start the Flask Service**:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl start flask_app.service
   ```
4. **Verify Service Status** to ensure proper operation:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl status flask_app.service
   ```

## Step 4: Configure Network Access

By default, Flask operates on port `5000`. It is imperative to ensure that this port is open for external access.

### Using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

If `ufw` is used, execute the following command to open port `5000`:

```sh
sudo ufw allow 5000
```

### Using iptables

For `iptables`, allow incoming traffic on port `5000` using:

```sh
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5000 -j ACCEPT
```

### Cloud Provider Security Groups

If your server is hosted by a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), ensure that the security group or firewall settings permit incoming connections on port `5000`.

## Step 5: Add HTTPS Support

To add HTTPS support to your Flask application, you can use a reverse proxy server such as **Nginx**. Nginx will handle incoming HTTPS requests and forward them to your Flask application running Gunicorn.

### Step 5.1: Install Nginx

First, install Nginx on your server:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

### Step 5.2: Obtain an SSL Certificate

Use **Let's Encrypt** to obtain a free SSL certificate. Install **Certbot** to manage the SSL certificates:

```sh
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

### Step 5.3: Configure Nginx

Create an Nginx configuration file for your Flask application:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/flask_app
```

Add the following configuration to the file:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

- Replace `your_domain.com` and `www.your_domain.com` with your actual domain name.

Enable the configuration by creating a symbolic link to the `sites-enabled` directory:

```sh
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/flask_app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

Test the Nginx configuration:

```sh
sudo nginx -t
```

Reload Nginx to apply the changes:

```sh
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Step 5.4: Obtain SSL Certificate with Certbot

Run the following command to obtain and configure the SSL certificate:

```sh
sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain.com -d www.your_domain.com
```

Follow the prompts to complete the certificate installation.

### Step 5.5: Update Nginx Configuration for HTTPS

After obtaining the SSL certificate, Nginx will automatically update the configuration to redirect HTTP to HTTPS. The updated configuration will look like this: sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/mywebsite

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    server_name chat.abatecdigital.es;

    # SSL configuration
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/chat.abatecdigital.es/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/chat.abatecdigital.es/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

    # Serve your website from /var/www/mysite at the root "/"
    root /home/sergio/mdrag/web_example;
    index index.html index.htm;

    # Location block for your main website at "/"
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    # Location block for Streamlit app at "/app"
    location /app/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8501/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        rewrite ^/app/(.*) /$1 break;
    }

    # Location block for Streamlit app at "/app"
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        rewrite ^/app/(.*) /$1 break;
    }
}

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name chat.abatecdigital.es;

    # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}
```

Reload Nginx to apply the HTTPS configuration:

```sh
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Summary

This guide has provided a comprehensive overview of:

1. Setting up a virtual environment for a Flask application.
2. Creating a systemd service file to deploy the Flask application using Gunicorn in a production environment.
3. Configuring network access to enable external connectivity via port `5000`.
4. Adding HTTPS support using Nginx as a reverse proxy and Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates.

Using a production-ready WSGI server such as Gunicorn and configuring it with systemd ensures the Flask application remains reliable, restarts automatically in the event of a failure, and starts on system boot. For enhanced performance and security, the addition of Nginx as a reverse proxy with HTTPS ensures secure communication between clients and the server.
