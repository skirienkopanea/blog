## Introduction
Ben Eater is an online educator on computer-related topics from which I'm following his 8-bit computer project. [https://eater.net/8bit](https://eater.net/8bit). The computer is composed of different modules, which are built on breadboards. The modules are the clock module, registers and ALU (arithmetic and logic unit) module, RAM (random access memory) and program counter module, and output and control logic module.
