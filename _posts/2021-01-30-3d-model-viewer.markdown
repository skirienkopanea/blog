I recently made a simple 3D model viewer intended to be embedded and since I'm also just getting started with markdown/jekyll/ruby it's a good opportunity to check how to insert an iframe element for the first time. You can find the source code at [skirienkopanea/3d](https://github.com/skirienkopanea/3d).
<div class="cannot-use-iframe-directly-must-place-it-within-div">
    <iframe title="A 3D model" width="100%" height="480" src="https://hereinmygarage.herokuapp.com/" allowfullscreen=true></iframe>
</div>
