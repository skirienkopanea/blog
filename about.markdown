I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student at TU Delft, located in [the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands).
In this blog I share some notes and side projects related to my studies, all of them listed by topic in the Index page. You can also browse study files and online resources in the Downloads page.

If you've noticed a mistake, have a suggestion or simply just want to say "hi", do not hesitate to write me an email to [s.kirienkopanea@student.tudelft.nl](mailto:s.kirienkopanea@student.tudelft.nl).
