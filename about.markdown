In this blog I share some notes and side projects related to some Computer Science & Engineering bachelor courses from TU Delft.
You can also download files from the [Downloads]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads) page.

My posts and files may contain mistakes and some content might be (partially) copied directly from the book/slides, credits are implicitly given to all of the authors that contributed to the respective course (CSE####).

If you'd like my notes to cite your work explicitly, would like me to take some of my posts or files down, have noticed a broken link or a mistake, have a comment, suggestion or simply just want to say hello, you can send me an e-mail to [s.kirienkopanea@student.tudelft.nl](mailto:s.kirienkopanea@student.tudelft.nl).
